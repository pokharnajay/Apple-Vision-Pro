# <p align="center">ï£¿ Apple Vision Pro Clone</p>

This project is a clone of the Apple Vision Pro website, showcasing the use of GSAP and ScrollTrigger for animations, as well as Locomotive for smooth scrolling and additional animations. The primary technologies used include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project aims to replicate the visual and interactive aspects of the original Apple Vision Pro site.

### Key Features

- GSAP and ScrollTrigger for advanced animations.
- Locomotive for smooth scrolling experience.
- HTML, CSS, and JS for structure, styling, and interactivity.

### Challenges and Future Features

While developing this project, I encountered challenges in replicating certain intricate animations. In the future, I plan to implement additional features, optimize performance, and enhance the overall user experience.
